        When we started working on this task, we knew that accessibility and inclusivity are important factors when
        making a modern website.

        You want to be visible among the thousands of other webpages out there, so your page needs to be aesthetically
        pleasing, and it must be easy to both understand and to navigate. If it isn’t, your potential customers will
        choose one of the other (almost countless) options.

        There are also those as well with more special need to consider, if you want to make a fully inclusive and
        universal website.

        Therefore, from our first design discussion and talks on how to attack this assignment, we prioritized ease of
        use and high contrast coloring. The colors are aesthetically pleasing, but, and more importantly, they are easy
        to both see and read.

        The important parts of the website are bigger in size and are repeated on several pages. Allergens are marked on
        two different pages, both with their dishes, as well as with their own key page explaining their meaning. We
        made the allergen symbols clickable and linked them to the key page as well, so customers can move with ease to
        check the meaning behind the symbols.

        After running our website, which turned out to be a bit more complicated than first planned or expected, through
        the AChecker, we ended up with fewer issues than we could’ve feared.

        Mostly we had &ltlabel&gt and &ltalt&gt issues with HTML that created a bit of problem for us, as we’re not all too
                familiar with the tags. We aren’t too familiar with working together on the same code, so there were
                some issues with copying the code back and forth.

                On the CSS side we had the problem of excess code. Mostly instances where several lines did the same
                thing to the object. This comes back to us not being too confident with the use of the CSS rules, and
                how much that needs to be done for every element. Luckily for us, it’s an easy fix.

                Because of the scope of our website, we discussed how to link to this rapport on the website. We ended
                up adding an information link at the bottom of the front page.
